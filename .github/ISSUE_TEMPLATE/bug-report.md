## Bug Report

Make sure to review these points before submitting issues - thank you!

- Make sure a similar issue does not exist yet: use the search box.
- **Include reproducible code**: we should be able to paste it into an editor, run it and get the same error as you. Otherwise it's impossible for us to reproduce the bug.
- Write code in the issue itself.
- Reduce code, if possible, to the minimum size that reproduces the bug.
- If all of the above is impossible due to a large project, create a branch that reproduces the bug and point us to it.
- Provide details about the environment like how you are running Pipy, services, client software etc. The more the details, the better it will help us understand and diagnose the problem.
- Include `pipy` version (`pipy -v`), `NodeJS` version (`node -v`), `npm` or `yarn` version, and OS. If possible, try to see if the bug still reproduces on master.
